 Potato Disease Classification using CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to classify potato leaf images into three categories: Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight. The model achieves over 98% accuracy through data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.

It includes:

Model Training using TensorFlow and tf.data pipelines

Model Optimization with quantization and conversion to TensorFlow Lite

Backend Server using FastAPI + TensorFlow Serving

Frontend:

Web App (Flask + React.js)

Mobile App (React Native + TensorFlow Lite)

Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
